## Fishing splash/bobber sound files.
Makes a 'DING' sound instead of the quiet splash to make it easier to hear.
(spoken one says the word 'FISH'. Rename that to 'FishBite.ogg' and 'FishingBobber_ver2[1..3].ogg' if you want to use that one)
Place Fishing sound files in these locations in each of the game versions you want to change the sound for:
```
..\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Sound\spells\Tradeskills\FishBite.ogg"
..\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Sound\spells\FishingBobber_ver2_1.ogg"
..\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Sound\spells\FishingBobber_ver2_2.ogg"
..\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Sound\spells\FishingBobber_ver2_3.ogg"
```
